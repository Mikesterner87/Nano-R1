## Introduction

In the realm of natural language processing, fine-tuning models for specific tasks is essential for achieving high performance. The **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** model is designed to understand and generate human-like text. This project focuses on fine-tuning this model using **GRPO** to enhance its performance on the **GSM8K dataset**, which consists of various mathematical problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Nano-R1** project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mikesterner87/Nano-R1.git
cd Nano-R1
```

### Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- Fine-tuning of the **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** model.
- Implementation of **GRPO** for effective training.
- Utilization of the **GSM8K dataset** for model evaluation.
- Support for various adapters and configurations.
- Easy integration with Hugging Face libraries.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install the required libraries. The `requirements.txt` file contains all necessary dependencies. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to have the following libraries installed:

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `safetensors`
- `trl`
- `text-generation-inference`

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can start fine-tuning the model. Use the following command to begin the training process:

```bash
python train.py --dataset gsm8k --model qwen2-5
```

You can adjust parameters in the `train.py` script to customize your training process. Refer to the comments in the code for guidance.

### Example of Fine-Tuning

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the fine-tuned model for text generation:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your_fine_tuned_model"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

input_text = "What is 7 + 5?"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to load your fine-tuned model and generate text based on a prompt.
